Source code of my website that create cute aesthetic "Random Anime Quote" cart that you can download it and add it to your ig story or share it with your friends :3

!! I DONT HAVE ANY PLAN TO RUN THIS WEBSITE !!


## How it works
I create this [React.js](https://react.dev) app with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) library as a part of my [Portfolio](https://github.com/cwpslxck/Portfolio)

Its simply get information from [Animechan.xyz](https://animechan.xyz/) api.

Then show it as a cart with "quote" "anime name" and "character name".

then you can download it as a .png file via [html-to-image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-to-image) react library.
